# Lost-Found

Universities are busy places. There is a lot of coming and going. People are moving from one class to the next. They also frequent the hangouts between classes and are all over the campus. 
When people are this busy some of their personal items may get lost. A person may take their coat off and forget it. Students lose their briefcases and bags all of the time. There can be some personal information or items of sentimental value that accidentally get left behind. Many universities have lost and found boxes but people may not know where they are located to check for items. Universities can help students and other visitors get their items back. 
Lost and Found software makes it easy to post and manage items that have been lost and turned into the university. Lost & Found will be a web-app for the college students to have a central app to look for the items they have lost on the college campus. This helps to ease the stress associated with losing oneâ€™s possessions and a safe, hassle-free process to acquire it back.
